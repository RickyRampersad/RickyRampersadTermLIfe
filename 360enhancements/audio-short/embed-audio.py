"""Fold the narration MP3s into short.html as data URIs.

The film has to stay a single file: the wall plays it in an iframe and the
hosted copy runs under a policy that will not fetch a sibling asset, so an
<audio src="line01.mp3"> would be silent in exactly the two places it matters.

Run ./build-voice.sh first, then this. Re-running is safe — it replaces
whatever is between the markers. It also prints the measured line lengths, so
the SCENES and CUES tables in short.html can be checked against the audio that
is actually in it.
